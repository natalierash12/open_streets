<p>In October 2021, the Department of Transportation presented data at a Queens Community Board 3 meeting that suggested crashes have decreased along 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights since the Open Streets program started in April 2020, toward the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Laura Shepard, the Queens organizer for non-profit street safety group Transportation Alternatives, said that she thinks there is a direct correlation between the start of Open Streets and the decrease in crashes, both with and without injuries.</p>

<p>“It’s simply because there are very few cars using 34th Avenue from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. when there are a lot of pedestrians out and about,” she said, referring to the hours that the Open Streets are made available each day and the volume of people that use them. “It tracks; fewer vehicles, fewer crashes.”</p>

<p>The DOT compiled a 3 year average from March 2017-March 2020, and then from May 2020-May 2021 in order to show the number of crashes with and without injuries that occurred along the avenue before and after the program was implemented.</p>

<p>The data collected for this chart has been expanded to encompass the full length of time between March 2017 and May 2021, giving a broader scope of the trend and crash statistics from the start of the 34th Avenue Open Streets up until this past May.</p>
